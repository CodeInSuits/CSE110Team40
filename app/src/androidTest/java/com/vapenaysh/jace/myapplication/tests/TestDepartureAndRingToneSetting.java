 * When my partner arrives at that favorite location
 * Then I will be notified by a text notification shown on the top of the screen as well as

 *
 * Scenario 2: I get notified by customized location sound tone
 * Given that My partner already set a favorite location

 * When my partner arrives at that favorite location
 * Then I will be notified by a text notification shown on the top of the screen as well as

 *
 *
 * [Story 4]: User will be notified when his/her partner arrives/departs at a location by a
 * unique and fixed arrival/departure sound tone.
 *
 * Scenario 3: I get notified by the fixed and unique departure sound tone
 * Given that that my partner is in the vicinity of one of their favorite locations
 * And I already got an entering location notification from my partner
